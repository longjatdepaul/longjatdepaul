#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I have the pleasure of teaching computer science at a local high school.  Below are a few details about the courses we offer.

---
## Computer Science Club
### Infrastructure
In this student-led program participants will have the opportunity to work with physical servers and learn about hardware, Linux operating systems, networking and virtualization. They can explore infrastructure as code (IaC) and configuration management tools to build and deploy simulated environments running inside a school lab.

---
## Intro to Computer Programming
### JavaScript
We will learn the basics of computer programming and use foundational coding constructs to develop interactive web pages, animations and games.

---
## AP Computer Science Principles
### Computational Thinking Practices
AP Computer Science Principles is an introductory college-level computing course that introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. Students learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students also explain how computing innovations and computing systemsâ€”including the internetâ€”work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical.

## AP Computer Science A
### Java Programming
AP Computer Science A is an introductory college-level computer science course. Students cultivate their understanding of coding through analyzing, writing, and testing code as they explore concepts like modularity, variables, and control structures.

---
## Intro to Artificial Intelligence
### Data Science
How do computers use data to infer information, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and predictions.

---
## Honors Java Programming
### Microservices
We will learn about technologies used to create light-weight scalable RESTful web services and develop a mesh for a mock service architecture.

---
## Honors Mobile App Development
### Interactive Design
We will learn about the interactive design process and apply the technologies used to create mobile applications to develop our own end-user product.
